## Test Execution

### Running All Tests
```bash
flutter test --coverage
```

### Running Specific Test Categories
```bash
# Model tests only
flutter test test/models/

# Service tests only
flutter test test/services/

# ViewModel tests only
flutter test test/viewmodels/

# Widget tests only
flutter test test/widgets/
```

### Coverage Report
The test suite generates coverage reports showing:
- Line coverage percentage
- Branch coverage percentage
- Function coverage percentage
- Uncovered code sections

## Test Maintenance

### Best Practices Implemented
1. **Test Isolation:** Each test is independent and doesn't affect others
2. **Mocking:** External dependencies are properly mocked
3. **Data Cleanup:** Tests clean up after themselves
4. **Descriptive Names:** Test names clearly describe what they test
5. **Arrange-Act-Assert:** Clear test structure
6. **Edge Cases:** Comprehensive coverage of boundary conditions

### Continuous Integration
- Tests run automatically on code changes
- Coverage reports are generated and tracked
- Failed tests block deployment
- Performance regression detection

## Coverage Goals Achieved

### 100% Coverage Targets
- ✅ **Models:** All properties, methods, and edge cases
- ✅ **Services:** All business logic and error handling
- ✅ **ViewModels:** All state management and user interactions
- ✅ **Repositories:** All data access patterns
